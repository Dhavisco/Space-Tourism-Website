# Space Tourism Website

## Overview
The "Space Tourism Website" project is a front-end coding challenge designed to test and improve my skills in responsive web design and modern JavaScript and CSS frameworks, specifically ReactJs and Tailwind CSS. The challenge was to build out a Space Tourism Website and get it looking as close to the design as possible, ensuring that the component is responsive and functional across all devices.

The primary objectives were to:
Implement a design as provided in the challenge brief, ensuring the component is functioning properly and visually appealing and matches the design specification across various screen sizes.
Utilize ReactJs and Tailwind CSS for styling to leverage its utility-first approach for a faster and more efficient development process.
Ensure that the website is accessible and performs well on a wide range of devices, emphasizing mobile-first design principles.
This project was an opportunity to practice implementing a design with precision, using React Js and a CSS framework in a real-world scenario, and focusing on responsive and accessible design. The use of Tailwind CSS aimed to streamline the styling process, allowing for rapid development without sacrificing the quality or responsiveness of the final product.

Goals
Accurately translate a design mockup into a functional website.
Practice and enhance my understanding of React Js and Tailwind CSS, focusing on functionality, utility classes to manage layout, spacing, typography, and responsiveness.
Develop the component with a mobile-first approach, ensuring that it looks great and functions well on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.
Apply best practices for web accessibility to ensure that the website is usable by as many people as possible.

### The challenge
Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size. (Desktop, Mobile)
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
